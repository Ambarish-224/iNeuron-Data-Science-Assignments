    "Market Basket Research (MBR) is a data mining technique that uses association analysis concepts to identify patterns in customer behavior. Association analysis is used to identify relationships between items that people purchase together. MBR uses this information to identify frequent co-occurrences of items and to create “rules” that can be used to predict future customer behavior. MBR can be used to indicate which items should be recommended to a customer based on their past purchases, or to identify items that should be placed together in the same section of a store. In addition, it can provide insights into customer preferences, enabling retailers to tailor their marketing efforts and product offerings accordingly."

Any new defect formed after the 5 clusters of defects have been identified must be listed as one of the forms identified by clustering. We need to explain this process using a simple diagram.\n",

It groups data points into k clusters based on their similarity. The algorithm starts by selecting k random centroids and assigns each data point to its nearest centroid. It then calculates the new centroids based on the mean of the data points in each cluster and repeats the process until the centroids no longer change.\n",
