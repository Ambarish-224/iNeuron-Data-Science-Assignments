    "Regular Expressions, also known as regex or regexp, are used to match strings of text such as particular characters, words, or patterns of characters. It means that we can match and extract any string pattern from the text with the help of regular expressions. it helps the programmers to Write less and cleaner code. it also avoids multiple use of if/else statements. Regular expressions are a powerful feature of any language and solve a particular class of problems extraordinarily well. They can be used to validate user input, extract relevant data from a string, or even modify a string based on its contents.\n",
