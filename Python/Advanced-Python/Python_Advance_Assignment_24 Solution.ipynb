    "\n",
    "In this function, we can't directly refer to the function in the program. The addition of this sentence avoids the endless loop of the program . We can use an if name == \"main\" block to allow or prevent parts of code from being run when the modules are imported. When the Python interpreter reads a file, the name variable is set as main if the module being run, or as the module's name if it is imported"

In that case it will return the module in which we are working on. Suppose if the module is being imported from some other module, then name will have the name of that module from where the current module has been imported.
